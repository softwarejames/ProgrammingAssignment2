## programming assignment 2: lexical scoping
## functions to cache the inverse of a matrix and retrieve it if it exists

## create a special matrix object that can cache its inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getsolve <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)
}


## compute the inverse of the special matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix
## if the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then the cacheSolve function should retrieve the inverse from the cache
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setsolve(m)
    m
}
